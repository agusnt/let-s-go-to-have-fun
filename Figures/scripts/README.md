# Figure scripts

A bunch of script to generate graphs using the previous directory script.

I  know, I know these are scripts to use an script that should made my life 
easier. But these scripts do almost everything, you only need to select the 
json file (maybe I can code another script that select the json and then call 
this script which call...)

## List of scripts

### Speedup.py

```Python
Generate a bar graph for speedup

@param $1 : json with the characteristics of the graph
@param $2 : output file (pdf)
@param $3 : file with the raw champsim data 
```

### Berti Sensitivity

This folder contains all the scripts necessary to generate heatmaps graphs to 
analyze the sensitivity of Berti to different confidence thresholds.
